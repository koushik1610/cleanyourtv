"""Make the Home button open the launcher instead of LG's home, and quit the apps you leave.

webOS does not let an app replace Home, or even see which app is in front, so this runs on
another always-on device on the same network (a Mac, a Raspberry Pi, a phone in Termux). It
watches the foreground app over the TV's remote-control service and, the moment LG's home
appears, launches the launcher on top. LG's home shows for about half a second.

Press Home twice within ESCAPE_SECONDS to stay on LG's home (for its menus).

webOS keeps an app in memory after you leave it, and on a 2 GB TV a few of them push the rest into
swap. So when the launcher comes back to the front, this closes the apps opened since (KEEP_OPEN
excepted). The launcher can't do it itself: the TV refuses to close apps for a client on the TV.

    python3 home-watch.py 192.168.1.50

Needs: pip install websockets. Pair once first (sync-apps.py does it).
